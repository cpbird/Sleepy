# Sleepy


This project is aimed at comparing my personal data about sleeping and other health metrics from two sources:
        -Cpap Machine
        -Fitbit
                
Python Version 3.6
    
DATA:    
Pulling all the cpap data was done using sleepyhead:
https://sleepyhead.jedimark.net/
Sleepyhead has a export csv function that I used to create the csv file needed
The fitbit data is exported through their site and comes in JSON format.


The project can be refactored to include more user input so that the date range and which variables to compare take user
input and then return the results. I had no need for this so it is still as is. Might revisit in the future and refactor this.
